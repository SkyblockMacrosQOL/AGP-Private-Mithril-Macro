3. Drag this 3 files into your mods folder.
4. Open the game.
5. Press H to start the macro and J to stop it.

TIPS WHEN USING THE MACRO:
- Disable profile viewer (Having profile viewer on is a hard risk option because when it right clicks for using mining speed ability you can open some gui and if  you move with a gui open you are beamed).
- If you have a god pot on disable every effect that gives speed and jump boost or you will never reach the spot of the blue wool.
- Turn down render distance to 2 or your game will crash.
- Even the macro is fully afk I dont recommend using it for +16h/day as it might be sussy.
