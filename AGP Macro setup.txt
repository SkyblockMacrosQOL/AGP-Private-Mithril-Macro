HOW TO SETUP AGP MITHRIL MACRO:
1. You will need forge 1.12 downloaded.
2. After you have forge installed and you have opened minecraft forge 1.12 download the mods folder zip.
3. Unzip the folder and move it to your .minecraft folder and replace the mods folder you already created.
4. Open the game.
5. Press H to start the macro and J to stop it.
If the game crashes after step 3 I recommend you creating a new .minecraft folder and repeating the steps. The crash might be caused because of any mod you had preinstalled.
TIPS WHEN USING THE MACRO:
- Disable profile viewer (Having profile viewer on is a hard risk option because when it right clicks for using mining speed ability you can open some gui and if  you move with a gui open you are beamed).
- If you have a god pot on disable every effect that gives speed and jump boost or you will never reach the spot of the blue wool.
- Turn down render distance to 2 or your game will crash.
- Even the macro is fully afk I dont recommend using it for +16h/day as it might be sussy.
